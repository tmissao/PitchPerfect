# PitchPerfect
PitchPerfect App developed during iOS Nanodegree

The app allows users to record a sound using the deviceâ€™s microphone. Also users can play the recorded sound with six sounds effects (slow, fast, high pitch, low pitch, echo and reverb)

This application interacts with the iOS AVFoundation library to record sounds from the microphone (AVAudioRecorder) and play recorded audio with effects (AVAudioPlayer, AVAudioEngine).
